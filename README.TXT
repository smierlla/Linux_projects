PROJECT TITLE: SpiCam 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: created a surveillance camera using a rasberry pi , and installed an 
image of the MotionPi software that enabled the camera to record if motion were to be detected. in addition
to that we used an ubuntu virtual machine to run a NAS( Network Attached Storage) server so that each time 
the camera picked up motion it would store it on the server. furthermore to remotely control the server we used 
another virtual machine and set it up SSH with a private key and a public key  to also enhance security.lastly,
we configured dns so that the administrator could have access from anywhere in the world.
